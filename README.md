##A Note from the Author

Thank you for purchasing *Essential Excel 2016*. Microsoft is constantly changing Excel. Some of the information that is in your book can change. I have created a website to keep up with these changes, and questions you may have. Once you have entered a login, you can view the site and enter any questions, problems, or comments.

The website is [http://professoroffice.com/Membership/logonstart.aspx](http://professoroffice.com/Membership/logonstart.aspx).
